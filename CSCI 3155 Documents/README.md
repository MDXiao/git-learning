##CSCI 3155- Principles of Programming Languages

Summary:

This course is about principles, concepts, and ideas that underly programming languages. We will dissect programming languages by constructing interpreters. The semester project is to construct an interpreter for JavaScript (incrementally). We will see that interpreters are the basis for realizing computation, and we will study the programming language theory that enable us to reason carefully about a language's design and implementation. Our approach will be gradual in that we will initially consider a small subset of JavaScript and then slowly grow the aspects of the language that we consider.
