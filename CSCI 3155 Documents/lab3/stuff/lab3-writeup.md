#Lab 3 Write up 
##Problem 3d

Explain wheter the evaluation order is deterministic as specified by the judgment form e -> e' .



##Problem 4

Consider the small-step operational semantics for JAVASCRIPTY shown in FIgures 7,8, and 9. What is the evaluation order for e1+ e2? How do we change the rules to obtain the opposite evaluation order?

##Problem 5

5a). Give an example that illustrates the usefulness of short-circuit evaluation.

5b). Consider the small-step operational semantics for JAVASCRIPTY shown in Figures 7,8, and 9. Does e1 && e2 short circuit? Explain.
